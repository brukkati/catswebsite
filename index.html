                    <h3>Feeding</h3>
                    <p>Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need a meat-based diet. It's important to feed them high-quality cat food and provide fresh water daily. Avoid feeding them dog food or human food, as it's not suitable for their needs.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="care-item">
                    <h3>Playtime</h3>
                    <p>Cats love to hunt and chase. Interactive toys like feather wands or laser pointers are great for stimulating their hunting instincts. Regular playtime helps keep them mentally and physically healthy.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="care-item">
                    <h3>Health Checkups</h3>
                    <p>Regular vet checkups are crucial for keeping your cat healthy. Vaccinations, flea prevention, and dental care are essential parts of their routine care. Don't forget to check their ears and coat for any signs of infection.</p>
